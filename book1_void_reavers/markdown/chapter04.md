# The Space Trucker's Lament

Captain Elisabeth Chen sat in the ruins of her cargo hold, surrounded by the scattered remnants of what had been a forty-million-credit shipment. The pirates had been efficient but not cruel—they'd taken what they wanted and left just enough for the *Stellar Mule* to limp to the nearest station. It was more than most crews could expect from an encounter with raiders, but that didn't make the loss any easier to bear.

"Status report," she called out to her first officer, David Park, who was overseeing the damage assessment.

"Could be worse, Captain," David replied, though his tone suggested he was trying to convince himself as much as her. "Primary systems are intact. We lost about seventy percent of the cargo, but they left us enough fuel and supplies to make it to Neptune Station. No casualties, just some bruises and wounded pride."

Elisabeth nodded, running her fingers through her graying hair. At forty-five, she'd been running cargo for over two decades, and this was her third encounter with pirates. The first two had been... different. More final.

"What about communications?"

''t be able to report in until we're within a few million clicks of the station.''

Smart. The pirates—Captain Vega's crew—had disabled their ability to call for help without crippling the ship entirely. It was almost considerate, in a twisted way.

"Captain," her engineer, Yuki Tanaka, appeared at the hold entrance. "You need to see this."

Elisabeth followed her to the engine room, where Yuki pointed to one of the secondary power couplings. A small device had been attached to it, blinking with a steady green light.

"Tracking device?" Elisabeth asked.

''am. It's... it's a repair module. Military grade. Our coupling was showing stress fractures—I was planning to mention it at the next maintenance stop. This thing is holding it together, probably better than new.''

Elisabeth stared at the device. "They fixed our ship?"

"Looks like it. There are three more on other systems that were marginal. Whoever did this knew exactly what they were looking at."

"Captain Vega mentioned she started as an engineering apprentice," David said, having followed them. "Maybe she noticed the problems during the boarding."

"And took time during a raid to fix them?" Elisabeth shook her head. "What kind of pirate does that?"

"The kind that spaced Marcus Kellerman for being a murderer," Yuki said quietly.

They'd all seen that part—the brief, vicious battle between the two pirate ships. Elisabeth had been certain they were about to witness their own deaths when the second vessel appeared. Pirates fighting pirates over prey usually meant no witnesses left behind.

But Vega had surprised them. Instead of the massacre Elisabeth expected, they'd gotten a professional robbery and a warning about cooperating. It was almost civilized, if you ignored the theft of most of their cargo.

"Set course for Neptune Station," Elisabeth ordered. "Best speed we can manage. The sooner we report this, the sooner we can forget it happened."

But as the *Stellar Mule* limped through space, Elisabeth found herself unable to forget. In her quarters that night, she pulled up what information she could find on Captain Zara "Bloodhawk" Vega. The criminal databases were thin on details, but what was there painted an interesting picture.

First confirmed appearance: eight years ago, already captain of a small raiding vessel. Suspected of dozens of raids since then, but with an unusual pattern. Ships hit by Vega reported minimal casualties, often none at all. Cargo stolen but life support and essential systems left intact. Several reports mentioned repairs done during raids, damaged systems fixed even as cargo was being stolen.

There was a standing bounty on her head, of course. The Hyperion Transport Consortium alone had posted five million credits for her capture. But there were also odd notes in the files, testimonials from surviving crew members who seemed almost grateful for their encounters with the Bloodhawk.

"She could have killed us all," one survivor had reported. ''ve heard of transport crews who weren't so lucky with other pirates.''

Elisabeth's communication console chirped. It was David, on watch duty.

''re picking up a distress signal. Looks like an escape pod, bearing two-seven-mark-four. Life signs are weak.''

"How far off our course?"

''s beacon identifies it as being from the *Void Dancer*.''

Kellerman's ship. One of his crew had survived the destruction and been drifting for... Elisabeth checked the chronometer. Three days now.

Protocol was clear. Distress signals required response, regardless of the sender's affiliation. But protocol had been written by people who'd never had to decide whether to save someone who might have murdered them under different circumstances.

"Alter course," she ordered finally. "We pick them up."

''s wise? If it's one of Kellerman's crew—''

''re someone who's been drifting in a pod for three days, David. Besides, they might have information about what happened. The authorities will want to debrief them.''

Six hours later, they tractored in the pod. Inside was a single occupant, a young man barely out of his teens, delirious from dehydration and oxygen deprivation. Elisabeth watched as her medical officer worked to stabilize him, noting the pirate tattoos on his arms, the scars that spoke of a violent life.

When he finally came around, his eyes were wide with terror. "Please," he croaked. ''t space me. I'm not... I didn't want...''

"Easy," Elisabeth said. ''re aboard the *Stellar Mule*. We picked up your distress signal. You're safe.''

The young man—he identified himself as Rico—laughed bitterly at that. "Safe. Right. You know who I am. What I was."

"You were crew on the *Void Dancer*."

"Was. Until Captain Vega blew us to hell." He struggled to sit up. ''s dead. Most of the crew too. Only reason I made it to a pod was I was down in maintenance when the torpedoes hit.''

"Why were you attacking us?" Elisabeth asked. "Two pirate crews after the same target seems like poor planning."

Rico shook his head. ''t after your cargo. Well, not primarily. Kellerman wanted to make a statement. Show the other crews that his way was the right way. That mercy was weakness.''

"By killing us all."

"Yeah." Rico wouldn't meet her eyes. ''t... I mean, I knew what Kellerman was when I signed on. But jobs are hard to find in the outer systems, and piracy pays better than mining. I told myself it was just theft, that the killing was rare. But lately...''

He trailed off, and Elisabeth found herself thinking of her own crew. Young people, most of them, trying to make a living in a universe that didn't offer many options. How different were they from Rico, really? A few choices, a bit of bad luck, and any of them could have ended up on the wrong side of an airlock.

"What will you do now?" she asked.

''t turn me over to the authorities? Try to disappear, I guess. Find work somewhere where nobody knows my face. Maybe try to do something useful with what's left of my life.''

Elisabeth made a decision that would have shocked her younger self. ''re short-handed. Lost some crew at our last stop, and the company's too cheap to hire replacements. You know your way around a maintenance bay?''

Rico stared at her. ''re offering me a job? After what I was?''

''m offering you a chance,'' Elisabeth corrected. "What you do with it is up to you."

Neptune Station was a sprawling commercial hub, one of the major waypoints between the inner and outer systems. The *Stellar Mule* docked at a repair berth, her battle damage drawing curious looks from other crews.

Elisabeth made her report to the Hyperion Transport Consortium representatives, detailing the encounter with both pirate vessels. The corporate security chief, a man named Bradford who'd never been further from Earth than Luna, listened with barely concealed irritation.

''re telling me,'' he said when she'd finished, "that Captain Vega actually protected you from another pirate crew?"

"She protected herself," Elisabeth clarified. "We just happened to benefit."

"And then robbed you anyway."

"Yes."

"After making repairs to your ship."

"Minor repairs, but yes."

Bradford threw up his hands. ''s cost this company millions of credits. The fact that she's less of a monster than some others doesn't make her a hero.''

"I never said she was a hero," Elisabeth replied evenly. ''m simply reporting what happened.''

"And this crew member you picked up? From the destroyed pirate vessel?"

"A survivor from a shipwreck. Maritime law requires—"

"I know what the law requires," Bradford interrupted. "I also know that harboring known pirates is a violation of your contract. This... Rico individual should be in custody."

''s a kid who made bad choices. He wants to go straight.''

''re caught.'' Bradford's eyes narrowed. ''m beginning to wonder if you've been in space too long. Perhaps it's time for a psychological evaluation, make sure you haven't developed any... sympathies that might compromise your judgment.''

The threat was clear. Push too hard, and Elisabeth would find herself grounded, her captain's license under review. The company had ways of dealing with troublesome employees.

"Of course, Mr. Bradford," she said, forcing a smile. "I apologize if my report seemed to suggest any sympathy for criminals. I was simply trying to provide complete information."

''d hate to see that investment wasted.''

After the meeting, Elisabeth found herself in one of the station's bars, nursing a drink that claimed to be whiskey but tasted like engine coolant. David found her there an hour later.

"Heard you got the Bradford special," he said, sliding into the booth across from her.

"Smug bastard," Elisabeth muttered. ''t last five minutes in a real crisis.''

"Probably not. But he signs our paychecks." David signaled the bartender for his own drink. "What are you going to do about Rico?"

''ll disappear into some corporate prison. Either way, a kid who might have had a chance at redemption gets screwed.''

"There might be a third option," David said carefully. ''s heading out to the frontier colonies. Always looking for experienced maintenance crew, doesn't ask too many questions about backgrounds. Rico could start fresh out there.''

Elisabeth looked at her first officer with new respect. ''s surprisingly devious of you, David.''

"I learned from the best, Captain." He raised his glass. ''t make it easy.''

They drank, and Elisabeth found herself thinking about Captain Vega again. The woman had chosen a hard path, outside the law but not without principle. How many others were out there like her, trying to carve out their own version of justice in the lawless void?

The next morning, Elisabeth arranged Rico's passage to the frontier, using her own credits to pay for it. The young man tried to thank her, but she waved him off.

"Just stay out of trouble," she told him. "And if you ever run into Captain Vega, tell her... tell her Captain Chen remembers the repairs."

Rico nodded, understanding more than was said. "I will, Captain. And thank you. For the chance."

As the *Stellar Mule* prepared to depart Neptune Station with a new cargo and a replacement crew member who asked no questions about their previous hire, Elisabeth received an encrypted message on her personal console. No sender identification, routed through so many relay stations it was impossible to trace.

It contained just two words: ''re welcome.''

Elisabeth deleted the message, but she kept the memory. Somewhere out in the black, Captain Zara "Bloodhawk" Vega was still flying, still raiding, still walking the line between pirate and protector. It was a dangerous game she played, one that would likely end in fire and vacuum.

But for now, for today, Elisabeth Chen was alive because of it. Her crew was safe. A young man had gotten a second chance. In a universe full of Marcus Kellermans and corporate Bradfords, maybe that was the best anyone could hope for.

The *Stellar Mule* undocked from Neptune Station, her holds full of new cargo, her course set for the outer colonies. Just another transport ship among thousands, carrying goods and stories across the infinite black.

In her captain's chair, Elisabeth Chen allowed herself a small smile. She'd been robbed by pirates and lived to tell about it. More than that, she'd been reminded that even in the darkest corners of space, there were still those who chose to be better than their circumstances demanded.

It wasn't much. But it was something.

And in the void between stars, something was always better than nothing.
