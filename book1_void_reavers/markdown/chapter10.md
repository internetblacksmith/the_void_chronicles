# The Corporate Armada

The boardroom of the Hyperion Transport Consortium occupied the entire top floor of their Earth headquarters, its transparent walls offering a view of the Pacific Ocean three hundred stories below. Around the obsidian conference table sat the most powerful corporate executives in human space, their combined wealth exceeding the GDP of most colony worlds.

"The situation is intolerable," declared CEO Margaret Hastings, her voice sharp enough to cut steel. ''s banking fraud. Then they save a quantum research facility from our own stupidity. And now they're claiming to have defeated some kind of alien threat? They're making us look like incompetents.''

"With respect, Margaret," interjected Director Hamilton of Quantum Dynamics, "they did save my facility. And according to our deep space monitoring stations, something anomalous did occur in the asteroid belt three days ago."

"Anomalous," scoffed Bradford, the security chief who'd once threatened Captain Elisabeth Chen. ''re calling pirate propaganda now?''

Diana Marsh sat quietly at the far end of the table, her corporate liaison cover intact despite her dealings with the pirates. She watched the executives argue, filing away every detail for her real employers—whoever they were this week.

"Enough," said a new voice, and the room fell silent. Adrianus Voss, Chairman of the Board and the richest human being in recorded history, rarely attended meetings in person. His presence here spoke volumes about the gravity of the situation. ''ve had dealings with these pirates. What's your assessment?''

Diana chose her words carefully. ''re organized, principled to a degree, and surprisingly effective. If they claim to have encountered something alien, I'd be inclined to investigate rather than dismiss it.''

"Investigate?" Hastings laughed. ''re criminals. Terrorists. We should be destroying them, not investigating their delusions.''

''s time we did just that,'' Voss said quietly. "Mr. Bradford, what would it take to eliminate the pirate threat once and for all?"

Bradford had clearly been waiting for this question. He activated a holographic display showing fleet distributions across human space. ''ve run the simulations. With our combined corporate security forces—Hyperion, Quantum Dynamics, Titan Industrial, and the others—we could assemble an armada of two hundred vessels. More than enough to sweep the outer systems clean.''

"The cost?" someone asked.

"Approximately eight hundred billion credits, including operational expenses and hazard pay for the crews." Bradford smiled coldly. "But considering the pirates cost us nearly that much annually in stolen cargo and increased insurance premiums, it would pay for itself within two years."

"And the governments?" Diana asked. ''t sit idle while we assemble a private military force that size.''

"The governments are stretched thin dealing with colonial unrest and economic instability," Voss replied. ''ll frame it as a security operation to protect commerce. They'll thank us for handling a problem they can't afford to address.''

The vote was almost unanimous. Within the hour, orders went out across human space. Corporate security forces began to mobilize, mercenary companies received lucrative contracts, and shipyards started rushing military refits. The Corporate Armada was born.

In the asteroid belt, Captain Zara Vega received word of the corporate mobilization from an unexpected source.

"Diana Marsh," she said, recognizing the encrypted signature. ''d surface again.''

The message was brief but chilling: ''re ready to move. The alien threat you reported has been dismissed as fiction. They're coming for you all. - A friend.''

Zara read the message twice, then called an emergency meeting of her senior staff.

"Two hundred ships?" Jax said after she'd briefed them. ''s not a fleet, that's an invasion force.''

''s worse than that,'' Chen added, running calculations. "If they coordinate properly, they could blockade every pirate haven simultaneously. Cut off our supplies, starve us out, then pick us off at their leisure."

''t let them coordinate,'' Kira suggested. ''re ready, while they're still assembling.''

"With what?" Malik asked. "Even with the mutual defense pact, we maybe have sixty ships total. And half of those are converted freighters, not warships."

Zara studied the star charts spread across the table. Sixty ships against two hundred. It was impossible odds, the kind that got people killed. But running wasn't an option either. The corporations wouldn't stop until every pirate was dead or captured.

"We need allies," she decided. ''t want to see the corporations controlling all space travel.''

''t fight for pirates,'' Jax pointed out.

"No, but they might fight against corporate monopoly." Zara highlighted several systems on the map. ''t stop with pirates...''

''s a long shot,'' Chen said.

''s the only shot we have.''

The next three weeks saw frantic activity across the outer systems. Pirate envoys visited independent colonies, carrying evidence of corporate overreach and promises of mutual support. Some doors slammed shut immediately. Others opened cautiously, colony leaders willing to at least hear what the pirates had to say.

The breakthrough came at Proxima Station, a fiercely independent trading hub that had resisted corporate influence for decades. Governor Sarah Kozel, a former freight captain who'd built the station from nothing, listened to Zara's proposal with growing interest.

''re asking me to ally with pirates against the most powerful economic forces in human space,'' she summarized. ''s either very brave or very stupid.''

"Maybe both," Zara admitted. ''s to stop them from using it against anyone who defies them? Today it's pirates. Tomorrow it could be independent stations that refuse to pay their tariffs.''

Kozel was silent for a long moment. Then: ''ve seen what happens when the corporations get too much power. Worlds stripped bare, populations enslaved by debt, freedom sacrificed for profit. If you're right about this Armada...''

''s the intelligence we've gathered.'' Zara transmitted the data Diana had provided, plus what pirate networks had uncovered. Ship movements, supply requisitions, mercenary contracts—all pointing to a massive military buildup.

"Damn," Kozel breathed. ''re really doing it. The biggest private military force in history.'' She looked up at Zara. "What do you need from us?"

''s free colonies defending themselves against corporate aggression...''

"The narrative changes." Kozel nodded slowly. ''ll need to consult with the other independent governors. But I think... yes, I think they'll see the necessity. Give me two days.''

Two days later, the Free Colony Alliance was born. Seventeen independent systems pledged ships and resources to resist the Corporate Armada. It wasn't enough to match the corporate forces, but it was a start.

More importantly, it changed the conversation. Media outlets across human space picked up the story. Suddenly, the corporations weren't just hunting pirates—they were threatening the independence of free colonies. Public opinion, already soured by decades of corporate scandals, began to shift.

In the Hyperion boardroom, Adrianus Voss watched the media coverage with cold fury.

"This was supposed to be a simple police action," he said, his voice dangerously quiet. ''re being painted as tyrants.''

''s Vega,'' Bradford insisted. ''s orchestrated this entire propaganda campaign. Remove her, and the alliance crumbles.''

"Then remove her," Voss commanded. "Whatever it takes."

The assassination attempt came five days later. Zara was meeting with colony representatives on Port Liberty when her security detail detected the threat—a corporate kill team disguised as maintenance workers.

The firefight was brief but vicious. Zara's people were ready, and the assassins found themselves outgunned and outmaneuvered. But the damage was done. The attempt on her life, captured on station security cameras, provided powerful evidence of corporate ruthlessness.

"They tried to murder a negotiator during peace talks," Governor Kozel announced to the assembled media. "Is this the future the corporations offer? Rule through assassination and fear?"

The Corporate Armada launched two weeks ahead of schedule, their plans disrupted but not derailed. One hundred and eighty-seven ships, the largest fleet assembled since the Colonial Wars, began moving toward the asteroid belt.

Against them stood the Pirate-Colonial Alliance: sixty-three pirate vessels and forty-two colonial defense ships, supplemented by converted freighters and mining vessels. One hundred and five ships total, most inferior to their corporate counterparts.

The two fleets met at Vesta, the second-largest asteroid in the belt. Zara had chosen the battlefield carefully—the asteroid's gravity well and debris field would neutralize some of the Armada's numerical advantage.

"All ships, this is Admiral Chen Wei of the Free Colony Alliance," her former pilot announced. He'd been elected to command the combined fleet, a pirate leading colonists into battle. "Today we fight not for plunder or profit, but for freedom itself. The corporations would make slaves of us all, pirates and colonists alike. We stand here to say: No more."

The battle began at extreme range, corporate dreadnoughts launching waves of missiles while alliance ships used the asteroids for cover. The superior corporate firepower told immediately, several lighter pirate vessels vanishing in nuclear fire.

But Zara had one more card to play.

"Execute Prometheus Protocol," she commanded.

Across the alliance fleet, modified quantum field generators came online. Based on the research data from the destroyed science ship, Chen and other engineers had developed a localized quantum disruption field. It couldn't fold space like a true quantum drive, but it could wreak havoc on enemy targeting systems.

Suddenly, corporate weapons that never missed were flying wide. Sensor locks failed and reformed randomly. The organized Armada assault devolved into chaos as their technological advantage evaporated.

"All ships, attack pattern omega!" Zara commanded. ''re blind!''

The alliance fleet surged forward, pouring fire into the confused corporate lines. Pirate raiders, used to fighting in chaotic melees, adapted quickly. Colonial defense ships, crewed by people defending their homes, fought with desperate fury.

The *Crimson Revenge* led a squadron directly at the corporate flagship, a massive dreadnought that dwarfed any three pirate vessels. But size meant nothing when your weapons couldn't lock on target.

"Rodriguez, you seeing this?" Zara called to her wingman.

"I see it, Bloodhawk!" Maria Rodriguez, recovered from her injuries and commanding a new ship, laughed over the comm. ''s show these corporate bastards how pirates dance!''

The battle raged for six hours. Ships died on both sides, fire and vacuum claiming the brave and cowardly alike. But slowly, impossibly, the alliance began to gain ground. The corporate fleet, trained for orderly engagements, couldn't adapt to the quantum-disrupted chaos.

Then, just as victory seemed possible, space itself tore open.

The alien ship that emerged dwarfed both fleets combined. It was a kilometer-long needle of impossible angles and flowing metal, and it announced its presence by vaporizing three corporate dreadnoughts with a single weapon discharge.

"All ships, all ships!" Zara broadcast on every frequency. "Cease fire! We have a bigger problem!"

The battle stopped as suddenly as it had begun, both fleets turning to face this new threat. The alien vessel hung motionless for a moment, scanning, evaluating. Then it broadcast a message in perfect, if oddly accented, human speech:

''Human.' You have destroyed a survey unit. You have accessed forbidden technologies. You will cease expansion immediately or face sterilization. Compliance time: one solar rotation. This is your only warning.''

The message repeated three times, then the alien ship simply vanished, leaving a quantum wake that set every sensor screaming.

In the silence that followed, corporate and alliance ships drifted among the debris of their battle, united by a threat that made their conflict seem suddenly, terrifyingly petty.

"Admiral Voss," Zara transmitted to the corporate flagship. "I think we need to talk."

The response came after a long pause. Not from Voss, but from Bradford, his voice shaken: ''m... I'm in command now. And yes, Captain Vega, I think we need to talk.''

The Battle of Vesta was over. The war for humanity's survival had just begun.
