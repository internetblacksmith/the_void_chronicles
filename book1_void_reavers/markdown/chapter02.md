# The Crimson Nebula

Deadman's Port hung in the shadow of the Crimson Nebula like a metallic tumor, its haphazard construction a testament to decades of unregulated growth. The station had started life as a mining outpost, processing the exotic gases that swirled within the nebula's heart. But when the mines played out and the corporations moved on, the criminals moved in.

Now it was the largest pirate haven in the outer systems, a place where stolen goods could be fenced, ships could be repaired with no questions asked, and the law was whatever the strongest crew said it was. The nebula's interference made it invisible to long-range sensors, and its location at the confluence of three major shipping lanes made it the perfect base for those who preyed on interstellar commerce.

Captain Zara Vega stood at the viewport of the *Crimson Revenge*'s observation deck, watching as they approached the station. The nebula's gases painted everything in shades of red and orange, like flying through the heart of a dying star. It was beautiful and terrible at the same time, much like the life she'd chosen.

''s Port Control, this is the *Crimson Revenge* requesting docking clearance,'' Jax's voice crackled over the intercom.

"*Crimson Revenge*, this is Control. Good to see you back, Bloodhawk. Heard you had some excitement out in the black. Docking Bay 47 is all yours. The Harbourmaster wants his cut, as usual."

''ll make it worth his while.''

Zara smiled grimly. The Harbourmaster—nobody knew his real name—took twenty percent of everything that moved through Deadman's Port. It was highway robbery, but it was also the cost of doing business in a place where the authorities couldn't reach.

As the ship maneuvered toward their assigned berth, Zara made her way to the cargo hold. Her crew was already there, taking inventory of their haul. Crates of rare earth metals were stacked to the ceiling, each one worth a small fortune on the black market.

''d we do?'' she asked Malik Torres, her quartermaster.

The older man looked up from his datapad, his cybernetic arm clicking softly as he made calculations. ''s cut and operating expenses, we're looking at about thirty-two million credits. Split twenty ways, that's 1.6 million per crew member.''

A cheer went up from the assembled pirates. For most of them, it was more money than they'd see in a lifetime of honest work.

''t spend it all in one place,'' Zara cautioned. ''re here. Deadman's Port might be neutral ground, but that doesn't mean we don't have enemies. Stay in groups, watch each other's backs, and for the love of the void, stay out of the Broken Compass.''

The Broken Compass was Deadman's Port's most notorious tavern, a place where disputes were settled with knives and plasma bolts rather than words. More pirates had died in its dimly lit confines than in many actual raids.

As the crew dispersed to begin unloading, Jax approached. "You planning to visit the old man?"

Zara nodded. ''s expecting me. Might as well get it over with.''

Admiral Nathaniel Krieger (retired) was Deadman's Port's unofficial mayor, the closest thing to authority the station had. He'd been a decorated fleet officer once, before a scandal involving stolen military hardware had forced him into exile. Now he maintained order among the pirates through a combination of respect, fear, and carefully balanced power.

The station's corridors were a maze of competing architectural styles, each section bearing the mark of whatever group had controlled it at the time of construction. Zara passed through the Merchant Quarter, where fences and black market dealers hawked their wares, through the Shipyard District, where the clang of metal on metal never ceased, and finally into the Administrative Core.

Krieger's office occupied the station's original command center, a relic from its mining days. Two heavily augmented guards flanked the entrance, their weapon implants gleaming in the artificial light.

"Captain Vega," one of them rumbled, his voice distorted by a vocal synthesizer. "The Admiral is expecting you."

The office beyond was a study in controlled chaos. Star charts covered every wall, marked with shipping routes, patrol patterns, and the ever-shifting territories of the various pirate crews. Krieger himself sat behind a massive desk made from the hull of a decommissioned battleship, his weathered face illuminated by the glow of multiple holographic displays.

"Zara," he said without looking up. "I heard about your encounter with Kellerman. Messy business."

"He had it coming," Zara replied, settling into a chair across from him. "The man was a rabid dog that needed putting down."

Krieger finally looked up, his steel-gray eyes studying her. ''ve put a bounty on your head. Fifty thousand credits.''

''m insulted.''

''t a joke, Zara. Kellerman had friends, allies among the other crews. You've upset the balance.''

"The balance was upset the moment he started massacring entire transport crews," Zara shot back. "Someone had to stop him."

"And you appointed yourself judge, jury, and executioner?"

"Would you have preferred I let him slaughter the crew of the *Stellar Mule*?"

Krieger sighed, suddenly looking every one of his seventy years. ''s death as an attack on all of them.''

The Crimson Brotherhood. Zara had heard of them—a loose alliance of the most violent pirate crews, united by their belief that mercy was weakness. Kellerman had been one of their rising stars.

"How many ships?" she asked.

''re gathering at Nexus Station, two days' jump from here. My sources say they're planning to make an example of you.''

Zara's mind raced. Three ships, maybe more, against her single vessel. Those weren't good odds, even for the *Crimson Revenge*.

"What do you suggest?"

"Leave. Now. Head for the inner systems, lay low for a few months. Let tempers cool."

''m running scared? No.''

Krieger leaned back in his chair. "Pride has killed more pirates than the navy ever has."

''t about pride. If I run now, I'll be running forever. The Brotherhood will see it as weakness, and every two-bit raider with delusions of grandeur will come after me.'' Zara stood. ''ll get one. But it'll be on my terms.''

"And what terms would those be?"

''m still working on that part.''

Krieger shook his head. ''re going to get yourself killed, Zara. And your crew along with you.''

''ll die free.'' She turned to leave, then paused. ''t forget it.''

"See that you live long enough to remember," he called after her.

Back in the corridor, Zara's mind was already working on the problem. Three ships against one wasn't impossible odds, but it would require careful planning and more than a little luck. She needed information—ship specifications, crew complements, weaknesses she could exploit.

Her communicator buzzed. It was Kira, her weapons officer.

''m at the Supernova Cantina, and there's a woman here asking about you. Says she has information you need to hear.''

"What kind of woman?"

''t made it to the general gossip yet.''

Interesting. ''m on my way.''

The Supernova Cantina was a step up from the Broken Compass, which meant the bloodstains were cleaned up daily and the drinks were only mildly toxic. Zara found Kira at a corner booth, sitting across from a woman who immediately set off every alarm in Zara's head.

She was too clean, too composed for Deadman's Port. Her clothes were high-quality but nondescript, designed to blend in anywhere. But it was her eyes that gave her away—cold, calculating, constantly scanning for threats. This was no pirate or trader. This was something else entirely.

"Captain Vega," the woman said as Zara slid into the booth. "My name is Diana Marsh. I represent certain interests that would prefer to remain anonymous."

"Corporate or government?" Zara asked bluntly.

A slight smile. "Does it matter? What matters is that we have a mutual interest in seeing the Crimson Brotherhood taken down a few pegs."

''m listening.''

''s profits. A return to the old ways—theft without unnecessary bloodshed—would be beneficial to all parties.''

"Except the Brotherhood."

"Except the Brotherhood," Diana agreed. "Which is why my employers are willing to provide you with certain... advantages in the coming conflict."

"Such as?"

Diana produced a data chip from her pocket, sliding it across the table. "Complete technical specifications on the three ships gathering to hunt you. Crew manifests, weapon loadouts, shield frequencies. Everything you need to level the playing field."

Zara didn't touch the chip. "And in return?"

''s power is broken, and things return to a profitable equilibrium.''

"And if I lose?"

''ve done my research, Captain Vega. You've survived twenty years in the black by being smarter than your enemies. I'm betting you can do it again.''

Zara studied the woman, weighing her options. It was obviously a trap of some kind—corporate spooks didn't hand out free intelligence without expecting something in return. But if the information was legitimate, it might be the edge she needed.

"How do I know this data is genuine?"

Diana stood. ''t. But ask yourself this—what do I gain by giving you false information? If you die, the Brotherhood grows stronger, which is exactly what my employers don't want.'' She turned to leave, then looked back. ''s Port in thirty-six hours. I'd suggest you be ready.''

After she left, Kira picked up the data chip, turning it over in her fingers. ''s bargain, Captain.''

"They all are, out here." Zara pocketed the chip. "Come on. We need to get back to the ship and start planning."

As they made their way through the station's crowded corridors, Zara couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. Diana Marsh's appearance was too convenient, too perfectly timed. Someone was playing a larger game here, and Zara and her crew were just pieces on the board.

But that was a worry for another day. Right now, she had a ship to prepare and a crew to rally. The Crimson Brotherhood wanted a war? She'd give them one they'd never forget.

Back aboard the *Crimson Revenge*, Zara called a meeting of her senior staff. They gathered in the ship's war room, a converted cargo bay that now housed tactical displays and planning tables.

''s the situation,'' she began, uploading the data from Diana's chip to the main display. ''s old associates.''

The specifications scrolled across the screen, and Zara heard several sharp intakes of breath. Each ship was a match for the *Crimson Revenge* individually. Together, they could tear her apart.

"The *Ravager* is captained by Marcus Steele," Jax said, studying the data. "Fast, heavily armed, but light on armor. He likes to get in close and overwhelm with firepower."

''The Witch' Kowalski,'' Chen added. ''s a sniper. Prefers to hang back and pick targets apart with long-range torpedoes.''

"And the *Void Reaper*?" Zara asked.

"Captain Alexei Volkov," Malik said grimly. "Former Spetsnaz. His crew is mostly ex-military. They board hard and fast, no survivors."

''ve got a brawler, a sniper, and a boarding specialist.'' Zara studied the tactical display. ''ll try to box us in—Steele coming in close while Kowalski pins us down from range, then Volkov moves in for the kill.''

"We could run," Malik suggested. "The *Crimson Revenge* is faster than any of them in open space."

"No." Zara's voice was firm. ''ll be running forever. We make our stand here.''

"Then how do we win?" Kira asked.

Zara smiled. ''s Port didn't become a pirate haven by accident. This station has... features that most people don't know about.''

She pulled up a different schematic, this one showing the station itself. "Before it was a pirate haven, this was a mining station. They processed volatile gases from the nebula. The old processing systems are still here, dormant but functional."

Understanding dawned on Jax's face. "You want to turn the station into a weapon."

"Exactly. We lure them in close, then vent the processed gases. One spark and half the docking ring goes up in flames."

''s... insane,'' Chen said. ''d be killing hundreds of people. Pirates, traders, everyone in that section.''

"No," Zara corrected. ''re pulling back, consolidating our defenses. The Brotherhood ships will think we're preparing for a siege, move in to press their advantage.''

"And then?" 

"Then we remind them why attacking someone on their home turf is a bad idea."

The room was silent for a moment as her crew digested the plan. It was risky, borderline suicidal. But it was also unexpected, which made it their best shot.

"What about Krieger?" Malik asked. ''t approve of us turning his station into a battleground.''

''ll complain, but he'll allow it.'' Zara looked around the room at her senior staff. ''t lie to you. This is going to be the fight of our lives. Some of us might not make it. If anyone wants out, now's the time. No judgment, no hard feelings. Take your share of the haul and find another ship.''

No one moved.

"All right then." Zara felt a surge of pride. This was why she'd survived so long—not just because she was smart or tough, but because she'd assembled a crew that would follow her into hell itself. ''s get to work. We have thirty-six hours to turn this station into a deathtrap.''

As her crew dispersed to begin preparations, Zara remained behind, staring at the tactical display. Three ships, three captains who wanted her dead. The odds were stacked against them, but she'd beaten long odds before.

In the crimson light of the nebula, she began to plan. The Brotherhood thought they were hunting a lone wolf, separated from the pack. They were about to learn that even a lone wolf could have teeth.

The next thirty-six hours passed in a blur of activity. Under the cover of normal maintenance, Zara's crew worked with sympathetic station personnel to prepare their trap. Ancient gas lines were reconnected, emergency vents were reversed, and explosive charges were carefully placed at key structural points.

The evacuation was handled with equal care. A "radiation leak" in Section C provided the perfect excuse to clear out the area where they planned to spring their trap. Most of the station's inhabitants were happy to relocate temporarily—radiation was one of the few things that scared hardened pirates.

Through it all, Zara coordinated with Krieger, who grumbled about the damage to his station but ultimately agreed that the Brotherhood needed to be stopped. He even provided some of his own people to help with the preparations, though he made it clear that Zara would owe him a substantial favor if she survived.

As the deadline approached, long-range sensors detected three ships dropping out of hyperspace at the edge of the system. The Brotherhood had arrived.

Zara stood on the bridge of the *Crimson Revenge*, watching the tactical display as the enemy ships began their approach. They were maintaining formation, coming in slow and careful. Smart. They knew she was dangerous, and they weren't taking chances.

"All hands, this is the Captain," she announced over the ship's intercom. ''s make it count. For the *Crimson Revenge*!''

The crew's battle cry echoed through the ship. In the weapons bays, gunners made final adjustments to their targeting systems. In engineering, the crew prepared to push the engines beyond their rated limits. In the boarding pods, marines checked their weapons and sealed their armor.

"Enemy ships are hailing us," Jax reported.

"Put them through."

The main screen split into three sections, showing the faces of her enemies. Marcus Steele was a brute of a man, all scars and cybernetic enhancements. Vera Kowalski was beautiful in a cold, deadly way, her eyes like chips of ice. Alexei Volkov looked like he'd stepped out of a military recruitment poster, all sharp angles and discipline.

"Captain Vega," Steele growled. "You killed our brother. Time to pay the price."

''s brother,'' Zara replied. ''re smart, you'll turn around and leave before I do the same to you.''

Kowalski laughed, a sound like breaking glass. "Brave words for someone outnumbered three to one."

''t everything,'' Zara said. ''t.''

Volkov spoke for the first time, his accent thick but his words clear. "Enough talk. You have one hour to surrender. After that, we take you by force."

"Come and try," Zara said, cutting the connection.

She turned to her bridge crew. ''re running for open space. Kira, prep a spread of torpedoes—I want them to think we're desperate. Jax, signal our people on the station. It's showtime.''

The *Crimson Revenge*'s engines flared to life, the ship pulling away from its docking berth and accelerating toward the edge of the station's defensive perimeter. Behind them, the three Brotherhood ships altered course to pursue, their formation spreading out to cut off escape routes.

''re taking the bait,'' Chen reported. "Increasing speed to match ours."

"Launch torpedoes," Zara ordered. "Wide spread, more for show than effect."

The weapons streaked away from the *Crimson Revenge*, forcing the pursuing ships to take evasive action. As expected, they easily avoided the attack, but it served its purpose—making them think Zara was panicking.

"New course," Zara commanded. ''re trying to use it as cover.''

The ship banked hard, its hull groaning under the stress of the maneuver. The Brotherhood ships adjusted their pursuit, closing in like wolves on wounded prey.

"Distance to Section C?" Zara asked.

"Three thousand kilometers and closing," Jax reported. "Our people report all preparations complete. Just give the word."

"Not yet. We need them closer."

The chase continued, the *Crimson Revenge* weaving between the station's docking arms and sensor arrays. The Brotherhood ships followed, their weapons lighting up space with ruby death. Shields flared as hits found their mark, and Zara felt her ship shudder under the impacts.

"Shields at sixty percent!" Kira called out. ''t take much more of this!''

"Just a little longer," Zara muttered, watching the tactical display. The enemy ships were almost in position, almost where she needed them to be.

The *Ravager* surged forward, Steele unable to resist the lure of a wounded target. His ship's forward guns blazed, hammering at the *Crimson Revenge*'s failing shields.

"Shields at thirty percent! Hull breach on deck seven!"

"Now!" Zara shouted. "Execute!"

On the station, hidden charges detonated, rupturing the ancient gas lines. Processed nebula gases—volatile compounds that had once powered the mining operation—vented into space in great gouts of crimson vapor. The cloud expanded rapidly, engulfing the pursuing ships.

For a moment, nothing happened. Then Zara smiled. "Kira, aft torpedo tube. Incendiary warhead."

"Aye, Captain!"

The torpedo launched, streaking back toward the expanding gas cloud. The Brotherhood ships, realizing the danger, tried to scatter, but it was too late.

The torpedo detonated.

The explosion was visible from half the system away, a new star born in the shadow of the Crimson Nebula. The processed gases ignited in a chain reaction, the fireball expanding outward with devastating force. The *Ravager*, closest to the epicenter, simply ceased to exist, vaporized in an instant. The *Blood Moon* and *Void Reaper*, further out, were caught by the shockwave, their shields overwhelmed, their hulls buckled and torn.

On the bridge of the *Crimson Revenge*, alarms screamed as the shockwave reached them. The ship bucked like a wild animal, throwing crew members against bulkheads. But Zara had timed it perfectly—they were just far enough away to survive, though not without damage.

"Damage report!" she called out, picking herself up from the deck.

"Multiple hull breaches, shields offline, engines at forty percent," Jax rattled off. ''re alive, Captain. We're alive!''

"Status on enemy ships?"

Chen checked his sensors. "The *Ravager* is gone. The *Blood Moon* is venting atmosphere—looks like her reactor is going critical. The *Void Reaper*..." He paused. ''s still functional, barely. Moving to intercept.''

Of course. Volkov and his military discipline. Even half-dead, he was still coming.

"Can we outrun them?"

"Not with engines at forty percent."

"Then we fight." Zara straightened her uniform. ''s oblige them.''

The two damaged ships limped toward each other through the debris field that had once been Section C of Deadman's Port. The *Void Reaper* launched boarding pods, desperate to close with their enemy before their own ship failed.

"Point defense guns!" Zara ordered. "Take out those pods!"

The *Crimson Revenge*'s defensive weapons spoke, filling space with rapid-fire plasma bolts. Some pods exploded, their occupants dying in the cold vacuum. But others got through, latching onto the pirate ship's hull like metallic parasites.

''re cutting through!'' someone shouted. "Boarders on decks three, five, and nine!"

"All marines to breach points," Zara commanded. "Everyone else, arm yourselves. We hold them here!"

She grabbed a plasma rifle from the bridge weapons locker, checking its charge. Around her, her bridge crew did the same. If Volkov wanted her ship, he'd have to take it corridor by corridor, room by room.

The first breach came on deck five. Volkov's marines poured through, disciplined and deadly. But Zara's crew was ready, meeting them with a wall of plasma fire. The corridor became a slaughterhouse, bodies falling on both sides.

On deck three, the boarders found themselves in a trap. Zara's engineers had rigged the section with explosive charges, waiting until the invaders were fully committed before detonating them. The explosion vented the entire deck to space, taking a squad of Volkov's best with it.

But it was on deck nine that the real battle was fought. Volkov himself led the assault there, his powered armor making him a nearly unstoppable force. He carved through defenders like they were made of paper, advancing steadily toward the bridge.

''s heading our way,'' Jax reported, watching security feeds. "Two decks down and closing."

"Then we meet him halfway," Zara decided. "Jax, Chen, with me. Everyone else, hold the bridge."

They met Volkov's squad in the main corridor of deck seven. It was brutal, close-quarters combat, the kind where skill mattered less than luck and sheer determination. Zara saw Chen go down, a plasma bolt taking him in the chest. Jax roared in fury, his shotgun thundering as he charged the enemy position.

And then she was face to face with Volkov himself.

He was even more imposing in person, his armor scarred from a hundred battles. His eyes, visible through his helmet's visor, were cold and professional. This was just another mission to him, another objective to complete.

"Captain Vega," he said, his voice amplified by his armor's speakers. "You fought well. But it ends here."

"Does it?" Zara raised her plasma rifle, knowing it was useless against his armor. "Tell me something, Volkov. Did you ever wonder why I led you here specifically? Why I chose this exact spot for our little trap?"

A flicker of uncertainty in those cold eyes. "What are you talking about?"

"This is deck seven. The same deck that suffered a hull breach earlier." Zara smiled. "The same deck where my engineers have been very busy."

Realization dawned just as Zara triggered the emergency beacon in her pocket. Behind Volkov, explosive bolts fired, and a massive section of the hull blew out into space. The decompression was instant and violent, sucking everything not secured toward the breach.

Volkov's armor was too heavy, his magnetic boots too strong. He stood firm as his unarmored squadmates were pulled screaming into the void. But Zara had counted on that. As he stood there, alone and off-balance, she didn't try to shoot him.

She tackled him.

The impact sent them both tumbling toward the breach. Volkov's superior strength meant nothing when he couldn't get leverage. They hit the edge of the breach hard, Zara's hands finding the manual release for his armor's power core.

"No!" he shouted, realizing what she was doing.

"Yes," she hissed, yanking the core free.

His armor went dead, two hundred kilograms of inert metal. The magnetic boots failed. And Alexei Volkov, veteran of a dozen wars, followed his men into the endless night.

Zara barely managed to grab onto a support strut, the emergency force field flickering to life seconds later to seal the breach. She hung there for a moment, breathing hard, before Jax's strong hands pulled her to safety.

"Captain! Are you insane?"

"Probably," she gasped. "Status report?"

''s left of her, anyway. No signs of other boarders—I think we got them all.''

Zara nodded, suddenly exhausted. They'd won, but at a cost. Good people had died today, and a section of Deadman's Port was nothing but floating debris. But the Crimson Brotherhood had been broken, their three best ships destroyed or crippled.

"Get us back to dock," she ordered. "And someone check on Chen."

As the battered *Crimson Revenge* limped back to Deadman's Port, Zara reflected on the day's events. Diana Marsh had been right—the information she'd provided had been crucial. But Zara knew there would be a price to pay eventually. Corporate spooks didn't do favors for free.

But that was a problem for tomorrow. Today, she'd survived. She'd protected her crew and her way of life. In the pirate havens across the outer systems, word would spread. Zara "Bloodhawk" Vega had taken on the Crimson Brotherhood and won. The old ways—theft without unnecessary murder—had been vindicated.

As the ship docked and her crew began the long process of repairs and recovery, Zara allowed herself a moment of satisfaction. In the lawless void between the stars, reputation was everything. And hers had just become legend.
