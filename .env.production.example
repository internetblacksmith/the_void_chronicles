# Railway Production Configuration
# These are set in Railway dashboard, not in a file

# Automatically provided by Railway
# PORT=<assigned by Railway, e.g., 2222, 8080, etc.>
# RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production

# Set these in Railway dashboard:
SSH_PORT=8022  # Use 8022 to avoid conflicts with Railway's PORT
SSH_HOST=0.0.0.0
SSH_PASSWORD=<your-secure-password>

# Railway TCP Proxy Configuration:
# Configure TCP proxy to forward external port to internal SSH_PORT (8022)
# 
# Note: If Railway assigns PORT=8022, the app will automatically move SSH
# to a different port and log the new port number
