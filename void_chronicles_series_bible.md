## Universe Rules & Consistency

### Quantum Mechanics
- Reality is malleable but requires deep understanding to manipulate safely
- Untrained manipulation causes "quantum wounds" that scar space-time
- Multiple attempts to fold space in same location creates cascade failure risk
- Consciousness plays a role in quantum field stability

### Alien Technology Levels
1. **Primitive**: Pre-space travel (like early humans)
2. **Standard**: FTL travel, basic energy weapons (humans during expansion)
3. **Advanced**: Quantum manipulation, dimensional awareness (humans post-probation)
4. **Transcendent**: Reality engineering, consciousness transfer (Architects, Shadows)
5. **Cosmic**: Universal constant manipulation, time control (Eternals)

### Pirate Evolution Arc
- **Phase 1**: Lawless raiders (Morrison era)
- **Phase 2**: Principled thieves (Vega's Code)
- **Phase 3**: Unofficial peacekeepers (post-probation)
- **Phase 4**: Quantum salvagers (interdimensional era)
- **Phase 5**: Reality gardeners (cosmic citizenship)

### Technology Progression
- **2150s**: Chemical rockets, basic plasma weapons
- **2200s**: Quantum drives, energy shields, AI assistance
- **2250s**: Dimensional sensors, reality-phase technology
- **2300s**: Pocket universe creation, consciousness backup
- **2350s**: Timeline navigation, universal constant adjustment

### Thematic Threads
- **Individual Growth**: Personal transformation mirrors species evolution
- **Balance**: Order vs. chaos, structure vs. freedom, guidance vs. independence
- **Responsibility**: Power requires wisdom, freedom demands accountability
- **Legacy**: How choices echo across generations and species
- **Perspective**: Same events viewed differently by various species/individuals

## Writing Notes

### Tone Consistency
- **Adventure**: Maintain space opera excitement throughout
- **Character Focus**: Personal stories drive cosmic events
- **Philosophical Depth**: Big questions explored through action, not exposition
- **Humor**: Dry wit from characters dealing with impossible situations
- **Hope**: Despite darkness, series trends toward growth and wisdom

### Recurring Elements
- Ships named after concepts (Crimson Revenge, New Horizon, etc.)
- Pirates using honorifics based on reputation ("Bloodhawk," "The Knife")
- Quantum technology having poetic/mystical descriptions
- Each species having distinct communication/technology patterns
- References to "the void between stars" as metaphor for potential

### Character Naming Conventions
- **Humans**: Mix of current Earth names (reflecting colonial diversity)
- **Architects**: Descriptive titles (Instructor-Prime-Seven)
- **Altairians**: Musical/light-based names (Resonance-of-Stars)
- **Pirates**: Reputation-based nicknames earned through deeds
- **Corporate**: Professional surnames with power implications
