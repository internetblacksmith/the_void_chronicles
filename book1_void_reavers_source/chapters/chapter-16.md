# Chapter 16: Pirates' Honor

The gathering at Deadman's Port was unlike any in pirate history. Every major captain, every significant crew, converged on the station that had seen so much blood and brotherhood over the decades. But this wasn't about territory or treasure. This was about survival—not just of piracy, but of the ideals that had transformed it.

Jax Torren, now captain of the *Crimson Revenge*, stood where Zara once had, looking out at the assembled pirates. Five years of leading the ship had aged him, added silver to his hair and weight to his decisions. But the crew still followed him, still believed in the vision Zara had started.

"Brothers and sisters of the black," he began, his voice carrying across the packed docking bay. "We face a threat not from corporations or governments, but from our own. The True Heirs claim to carry Morrison's legacy. They promise a return to the old ways—total freedom, no rules, no limits."

"And what's wrong with that?" called out Captain Reeves of the *Stellar Phantom*. "We're pirates, not social workers. Some of us remember when that meant something."

"It meant death," Maria Rodriguez interjected, stepping forward. Her years as patrol fleet commander had given her an authority that even traditional pirates respected. "I was there for the old ways. Ships vanishing without trace, crews spaced for sport, fear spreading like plague through the shipping lanes. Is that the legacy you want?"

"Better than bowing to aliens," Reeves shot back. "The Watchers have you all collared like dogs, and you're grateful for it."

"The Watchers kept us from destroying ourselves," said Admiral Krieger, his ancient voice still commanding attention. "Anyone here forget the cascade failure we almost caused? The shadow entities that nearly consumed Neptune? We're alive because we chose wisdom over pride."

The debate raged for hours. Some pirates had embraced the new order, becoming patrol officers and peacekeepers. Others chafed at the restrictions, longing for the freedom to raid without consequence. The True Heirs had found fertile ground among the dissatisfied.

Jax let them argue, watching, analyzing. He'd learned from Zara that sometimes people needed to talk themselves toward truth. But when voices grew heated and hands drifted toward weapons, he intervened.

"Enough!" His shout silenced the bay. "You want to know what the True Heirs really offer? Let me show you."

He activated a holographic display, showing recent footage from the colony world of New Shanghai. The images were horrific—burnt settlements, mass graves, a transport ship torn open to vacuum with its crew still inside.

"Three days ago, True Heir cells attacked New Shanghai because the colony was meeting its sustainability goals. They called it collaboration with the enemy. Forty-seven dead, including children. This is Morrison's true legacy—murder dressed up as freedom."

The bay fell silent. Even Reeves looked shaken.

"But that's not why I called this gathering," Jax continued. "I called it because we have a choice to make. Not between old ways and new, but between honour and chaos. The True Heirs think pirates can't have principles. I say we prove them wrong."

He pulled up another display—the Pirate Code that Zara had been drafting before becoming ambassador. Simple rules that preserved their independence while preventing atrocities.

"No killing of unarmed civilians. No attacks on medical or evacuation ships. No targeting of colonies meeting sustainability goals. Fair shares for all crew. Protection for those who can't protect themselves." He looked around the room. "This isn't alien law or corporate regulation. This is us, deciding who we want to be."

"Pretty words," Captain Morse said. He'd survived the Battle of Vesta and emerged more thoughtful. "But codes require enforcement. Who decides violations? Who carries out punishment?"

"We do," Rodriguez answered. "A council of captains, rotating membership, decisions by majority vote. Self-governance, not outside imposition."

"And if someone refuses to recognise the council's authority?"

"Then they're not pirates," Krieger said firmly. "They're terrorists, and they'll be hunted as such. By us, by the patrol fleets, by anyone with sense."

The debate continued, but momentum was shifting. Younger captains, those who'd come up under the new system, spoke of profitable raids conducted within the rules. Older pirates admitted that predictable restrictions were better than chaotic violence.

Finally, they voted. One by one, captains stepped forward to sign the Code or leave. Most signed. Some stormed out, vowing to join the True Heirs or forge their own path. But when the count was finished, over eighty percent of pirate crews had committed to the new order.

"This won't be easy," Jax warned the signatories. "The True Heirs will call us traitors, collaborators. They'll attack us as readily as they attack civilians. Are you prepared for pirates to war against pirates?"

"We've done it before," Rodriguez said. "When Kellerman threatened innocents, Zara stopped him. When the Brotherhood came for her, we stood together. This is no different, just larger scale."

As the gathering dispersed, captains returning to their ships with copies of the Code, Jax found himself approached by an unexpected figure. Diana Marsh, looking older but still sharp, had observed the entire proceeding from the shadows.

"Impressive," she said. "Zara would be proud."

"What are you doing here? This is pirate business."

"Everything is everyone's business now." Diana handed him a data pad. "Intelligence on True Heir positions, gathered by people who appreciate what you're trying to do. The corporations have no love for Morrison's legacy either."

Jax scanned the data. It was comprehensive—ship locations, supply caches, planned attacks. "Why share this?"

"Because the enemy of my enemy is useful. And because some of us remember when pirates saved corporate facilities from quantum disaster, when they fought shadow entities to protect colonies." She smiled slightly. "The universe is too dangerous for old grudges. We need pirates who honour their code, just as you need corporations that honour theirs."

She left, and Jax stood alone with the weight of leadership. The Code was signed, but paper meant nothing without action. The True Heirs would test their resolve soon enough.

The first test came within a week. A True Heir fleet attacked a convoy carrying medical supplies to a struggling colony. The convoy's distress call reached the *Crimson Revenge*, and Jax faced his first real decision as a guardian of the Code.

"It's a trap," Kira warned. She'd remained as weapons officer, loyal to the ship if not always comfortable with its new captain. "The True Heirs know we'll respond. They're counting on it."

"Of course it's a trap," Jax agreed. "But those medical supplies are real, and that colony needs them. We go."

They weren't alone. Three other Code-signing crews responded, forming an impromptu fleet. The *Solar Flare* under Rodriguez, the *Star Dancer* under a young captain named Lisa Park—daughter of the comm officer Zara had saved so long ago—and the reformed *Black Comet* under Morse.

The True Heir fleet was waiting, five ships against four. But numbers weren't everything.

"Pirate fleet, this is Captain Jonas Reeves of the True Liberation. Turn back now, or be destroyed as collaborators."

So Reeves had made his choice. Jax felt a moment of sadness—another pirate lost to Morrison's poison.

"Captain Reeves, this is the Code Fleet. Release the medical convoy and withdraw. This is your only warning."

"Code Fleet?" Reeves laughed. "Is that what you're calling yourselves? Pets of the aliens, more like. Morrison's vision will prevail, even if we have to burn every collaborator to see it done."

The battle was fierce but brief. The True Heirs fought with desperate fury, but the Code Fleet fought with purpose. They protected the medical convoy, disabled two True Heir ships, and sent the others fleeing. Reeves himself escaped, but his reputation was broken. He'd attacked medical supplies meant for dying colonists. Even pirates who hadn't signed the Code would think twice before joining him.

"First victory," Rodriguez said afterward, her ship nursing minor damage. "There'll be more battles."

"But we won this one," Lisa Park added. Her youth showed, but so did her determination. "We proved the Code means something."

Word spread quickly. The Code Fleet's victory, the medical supplies delivered, pirates choosing honour over chaos. Some True Heir cells defected, their members unwilling to wage war on their own kind. Others dug deeper, becoming more radical, more violent.

But something fundamental had changed. Pirates were policing pirates, enforcing standards, protecting those who needed protection. It wasn't perfect—it might never be—but it was progress.

Months passed. The Code Council convened regularly, addressing violations, mediating disputes, slowly building a culture of accountability. Some pirates couldn't adapt and left for the far reaches where no law held sway. But most found that structure, paradoxically, brought more freedom than chaos ever had.

Jax stood on the bridge of the *Crimson Revenge*, reading a message from Zara. She'd heard about the Code's success, about pirates choosing honour over anarchy.

"You've done what I couldn't," her message read. "Made it real, made it work. The Watchers are impressed. More importantly, humanity is safer. Keep flying, Captain Torren. Keep the faith."

He would. They all would. Because in the end, pirates' honour wasn't about rules imposed from outside. It was about choosing to be better than their worst impulses, about building something worth defending in the lawless black.

The True Heirs were still out there, Morrison's ghost still haunting the void. But against them stood pirates who'd found a different way, who'd proved that even thieves could have principles worth dying for.

The transformation Zara had started was complete. Pirates had become their own law, their own judges, their own future. And in the vast darkness between stars, that was the greatest treasure of all.
