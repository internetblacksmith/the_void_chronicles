# Chapter 3: First Blood

Twenty-five years ago...

The cargo hold of the *Fortunate Dream* reeked of fear and recycled air. Zara Vega, barely nineteen and still more girl than woman, pressed herself against a crate of mining equipment, trying to make herself invisible. Around her, two dozen other crew members huddled in similar positions, their faces pale in the emergency lighting.

"They're cutting through the outer airlock," whispered Tommy Chen, the ship's junior navigation officer and Zara's only friend aboard. His hands shook as he gripped an ancient pistol that probably hadn't been fired in years. "Captain Morrison's crew. We're dead. We're all dead."

Zara's own hands were steady as she checked the charge on the plasma cutter she'd grabbed from the engineering bay. It wasn't much of a weapon, but it was better than nothing. "We're not dead yet."

"You don't know Morrison," Tommy hissed. "He doesn't take prisoners. They call him The Butcher for a reason."

The sound of metal shrieking under thermal lances filled the hold. Zara had been working aboard the *Fortunate Dream* for six months, her first real job after escaping the corporate orphanage on Titan. It was supposed to be safe—just another cargo run through well-travelled space lanes. Nobody had expected pirates, especially not this far into the inner systems.

Captain Holbrook's voice crackled over the intercom. "All hands, this is the Captain. I've... I've negotiated our surrender. The pirates have agreed to take only cargo. Everyone is to remain calm and offer no resistance. Any hostile action will result in..." His voice broke. "Will result in immediate termination of the surrender agreement."

"Surrender agreement," someone scoffed. "Morrison doesn't make agreements."

The inner airlock cycled, and they came pouring in. Pirates, armed to the teeth, their faces hidden behind combat masks. They moved with military precision, spreading out to cover all angles. One of them, larger than the rest, removed his helmet to reveal a face that would haunt Zara's nightmares for years to come.

Rex Morrison was handsome in a cruel way, with dead eyes and scars that told stories of violence. He surveyed the cowering crew with the dispassionate gaze of a butcher examining cattle.

"Well, well," he said, his voice cultured, almost pleasant. "What have we here? The brave crew of the *Fortunate Dream*, reduced to hiding behind crates like rats." He gestured to his men. "Search them. Take anything valuable. Kill anyone who resists."

What happened next burned itself into Zara's memory with crystal clarity. One of the older crew members, Hansen, a family man with pictures of his kids plastered all over his bunk, stood up slowly.

"Please," he said. "We won't resist. Just take what you want and go. We all have families—"

Morrison's pistol barked once. Hansen crumpled, a smoking hole in his forehead.

"I find begging tedious," Morrison said conversationally, as if he hadn't just murdered a man in cold blood. "Now then, let's make this quick. My men will be taking your cargo, your fuel reserves, and anything else of value. You will all remain here, silent and still, until we're done. Anyone who moves..." He gestured at Hansen's corpse. "Well, you get the idea."

For the next hour, Zara watched as the pirates systematically stripped the *Fortunate Dream* of everything valuable. They were efficient, professional, and utterly without mercy. When one crew member whimpered too loudly, a pirate broke his jaw with a rifle butt. When the ship's doctor tried to treat him, she was shot in the leg as a warning.

But it was what happened near the end that changed Zara's life forever.

A young pirate, probably not much older than Zara herself, was searching through personal effects when he found something that made him pause. He held up a small holo-projector, the kind families used for pictures.

"Hey, Captain," he called out. "Look at this."

Morrison examined the device, and his cruel smile widened. "Bring her."

The pirates dragged out Lisa Park, the ship's communications officer. She was maybe twenty-five, pretty in a wholesome way, with kind eyes that were now wide with terror.

"This is you?" Morrison asked, showing her the holo. "You and the little girl?"

Lisa nodded frantically. "My daughter. Please, she's only four. She needs me. Please don't—"

"Don't what?" Morrison's voice was soft, almost gentle. "Don't take her mother away? Don't leave her an orphan?" He walked around Lisa slowly, like a predator circling prey. "Tell me, Lisa—may I call you Lisa?—what do you think your daughter would say if she knew mommy worked for the corporations that orphan thousands of children every year in their mining operations?"

"I'm just a comm officer," Lisa sobbed. "I don't make those decisions. Please, I'll do anything—"

"Anything?" Morrison's eyes glinted. "Would you kill one of your crewmates to save your own life? Would you choose who dies so you can live?"

"No! I couldn't—"

"Then you're useless to me." He raised his pistol.

That's when Zara moved.

She didn't think, didn't plan. One moment she was crouched behind the crate, the next she was on her feet, the plasma cutter humming in her hand.

"Wait!"

Every weapon in the room swung toward her. Morrison paused, his pistol still aimed at Lisa's head, and looked at Zara with something like interest.

"And what do we have here? A hero?"

"A trade," Zara said, surprised by how steady her voice sounded. "Me for her."

"Zara, no!" Tommy started to rise, but a pirate's boot sent him sprawling.

Morrison lowered his pistol slightly. "You'd die for her? Someone you probably barely know?"

"She has a daughter," Zara said simply. "I have no one. If someone has to die today, it should be me."

"Interesting." Morrison studied her like she was a particularly fascinating specimen. "How old are you, girl?"

"Nineteen."

"And what's your position on this rust bucket?"

"Engineering apprentice. I fix things."

"You fix things." Morrison laughed, a sound devoid of warmth. "Tell me, little fixer, have you ever killed anyone?"

"No."

"Would you? If I gave you a choice—kill Lisa here yourself, or watch me kill everyone in this room?"

The cargo hold went deadly silent. Zara felt the weight of every eye upon her. Her mind raced, searching for the right answer, the magic words that would save them all. But there were no magic words with men like Morrison. There was only survival.

"I'd kill you," she said finally.

Morrison's smile widened. "There it is. The honest answer." He holstered his pistol and made a gesture to his men. "Take her."

"Captain?" One of the pirates sounded confused.

"The girl. She comes with us." Morrison turned back to Zara. "Congratulations. You just became a pirate. Resist, and I'll kill everyone here, starting with Lisa and her daughter's future. Come quietly, and they live. Choose."

It wasn't really a choice at all.

As the pirates led her away, Zara caught Tommy's eye. He was crying, whether from fear or for her, she couldn't tell. Lisa Park was sobbing with relief, clutching her holo-projector like a lifeline.

The last thing Zara heard before the airlock sealed was Captain Holbrook's voice, broken and defeated: "May God forgive us all."

The pirates' ship, the *Blood Harvest*, was everything the *Fortunate Dream* wasn't. Where the cargo hauler had been all function and no form, Morrison's vessel was a predator built for its purpose. The corridors were narrow and dark, the air thick with the smell of ozone and violence.

They threw her in a cell that might have once been a storage closet. For three days, no one came except to slide food through a slot. Zara spent the time thinking, planning, trying to understand what had happened. Why had Morrison taken her? What did he want?

On the fourth day, she found out.

Morrison himself came to get her, flanked by two guards. He'd traded his combat gear for a captain's uniform that would have looked dignified on anyone else. On him, it looked like a costume.

"Come," he said. "Time to see if you're worth the trouble."

He led her to a training room where a dozen pirates were practicing hand-to-hand combat. They stopped when Morrison entered, snapping to attention with military precision.

"Kroeger," Morrison called out. A massive man stepped forward, all muscle and scars. "You've been asking for fresh meat for the pit. Here's your chance."

Kroeger looked Zara up and down dismissively. "This little thing? She won't last thirty seconds."

"Perhaps not. But that's what makes it interesting." Morrison turned to Zara. "Simple rules. Survive five minutes with Kroeger, and you get to live. Fail, and... well, you won't care what happens next."

"And if I refuse to fight?"

"Then I go back to the *Fortunate Dream* and finish what I started. Lisa Park's daughter becomes an orphan after all."

Zara stepped into the makeshift ring, her heart pounding. Kroeger grinned, cracking his knuckles. Around them, the pirates began taking bets, most putting money on how quickly she'd die.

The giant came at her like a freight train. Zara barely managed to dodge, his fist whistling past her ear. She tried to remember the basic self-defence they'd taught at the orphanage, but Kroeger was nothing like the practice dummies.

His second swing caught her in the ribs, lifting her off her feet. She hit the ground hard, gasping for air. The pirates cheered, scenting blood.

"Get up," Morrison said calmly. "Four minutes, thirty seconds left."

Zara rolled aside as Kroeger's boot slammed down where her head had been. She scrambled to her feet, circling, trying to stay out of reach. But the ring was small, and Kroeger knew how to cut off angles.

He caught her again, this time with a backhand that split her lip and sent her spinning. The taste of blood filled her mouth. The crowd was going wild, calling for the kill.

"Three minutes," Morrison announced.

That's when something changed in Zara. The fear didn't go away—it transformed. Became fuel. She'd survived the corporate orphanages. She'd survived alone on the streets of Titan. She'd survive this too.

When Kroeger came at her again, she didn't try to dodge. Instead, she went low, diving between his legs and coming up behind him. As he turned, she grabbed a handful of sand from the ring floor and flung it in his eyes.

"Bitch!" he roared, pawing at his face.

Zara didn't waste the opportunity. She kicked him hard in the knee, feeling something give. Kroeger stumbled, and she pressed her advantage, driving her elbow into his kidney.

It wasn't enough to drop him, but it was enough to make him angry. And angry people made mistakes.

"Two minutes," Morrison said, and was that approval in his voice?

Kroeger charged blind, relying on brute strength. Zara danced aside, letting momentum carry him into the ropes. She grabbed his hair, yanking his head back, and brought her knee up into his nose. Blood exploded across his face.

The crowd had gone quiet. This wasn't how it was supposed to go.

"One minute."

Kroeger was hurt but far from finished. He grabbed Zara's arm, his grip like a vise, and pulled her close. His other hand went for her throat. She could smell his breath, feel his rage.

So she did the only thing she could think of. She bit him.

Her teeth sank into his forearm, tasting blood and sweat. Kroeger screamed, loosening his grip just enough for her to wrench free. She stumbled back, spitting, as the giant clutched his wounded arm.

"Time," Morrison called out.

The room was silent. Kroeger stood there, blood streaming from his nose and arm, looking at Zara with something between rage and respect. She stood on shaky legs, bloodied but unbroken.

Morrison stepped into the ring. "Interesting. Very interesting." He turned to address the room. "Let this be a lesson. Size and strength are advantages, but they're not everything. Determination, cunning, the will to survive by any means necessary—these are what make a true pirate."

He looked back at Zara. "You've earned your life, girl. Whether you keep it depends on what you do next."

"What do you want from me?"

"I want to see what you become," Morrison said. "I've raided a hundred ships, killed more people than I can count. It all becomes routine after a while. But you... you interest me. A girl who would trade her life for a stranger's, then fight like a demon to keep it. There's potential there."

"Potential for what?"

"To become like me, of course." His smile was cold. "Or to die trying."

That night, in her cell, Zara examined her injuries. Split lip, bruised ribs, various cuts and contusions. But she was alive. More than that, she'd learned something important. Morrison might be a monster, but he was a monster with rules. With patterns. And patterns could be exploited.

Over the following weeks, her training began in earnest. Combat, weapons, tactics, ship operations—Morrison's crew taught her everything they knew. Some were cruel about it, taking pleasure in beating down the newcomer. Others, surprisingly, were almost kind, seeing in her a younger version of themselves.

She learned that many of Morrison's crew hadn't chosen this life. Some were pressed into service like her. Others were refugees from corporate wars, discharged soldiers, or simply people who'd fallen through the cracks of civilization. Morrison collected the desperate and the dangerous, forging them into an efficient killing machine.

But efficiency wasn't the same as loyalty. Zara saw the fear in their eyes when Morrison was near, the way conversations died when he entered a room. They followed him because he was strong, because he was successful, and because crossing him meant death.

Three months into her new life, Zara participated in her first raid. It was a small transport, barely worth the effort, but Morrison wanted to blood his newest recruit.

"Remember," he told her as they prepared to board. "Hesitation is death. Either theirs or yours. Choose."

The raid was a blur of violence and terror. Zara found herself moving on instinct, her training taking over. When a transport crewman raised a weapon toward her, she shot first, watching him fall with a detached sort of horror.

"Good," Morrison said afterward, examining the body. "Clean shot, centre mass. You're learning."

But that night, Zara couldn't sleep. The man's face haunted her—middle-aged, greying hair, wedding ring on his finger. Someone's husband. Someone's father. Gone because she'd been faster on the trigger.

"It gets easier," said a voice from her doorway. She looked up to see Marcus, one of the older pirates. He was one of the few who'd shown her any kindness. "The killing, I mean. After a while, you stop seeing faces. Just targets."

"Is that supposed to be comforting?"

Marcus shrugged. "It's survival. Morrison's right about one thing—in this life, it's kill or be killed. The sooner you accept that, the longer you'll live."

"Did you have a choice?" Zara asked. "When you started?"

"We all have choices," Marcus said quietly. "Just not always good ones."

As the months passed, Zara threw herself into learning everything she could. Not just the skills Morrison's crew taught, but the man himself. She studied his patterns, his moods, his weaknesses. Morrison was brilliant, charismatic, and utterly ruthless—but he was also arrogant. He believed his own legend, thought himself invincible.

That arrogance would eventually kill him. Zara just had to survive long enough to see it.

Her chance came almost two years after her capture. The *Blood Harvest* had been tracking a prize for weeks—a military supply convoy disguised as civilian transports. Morrison's sources insisted it was carrying experimental weapons worth a fortune on the black market.

"It's too well-guarded," argued Vance, Morrison's first mate. "Four ships, all armed. Even if they're pretending to be civilians, they'll have teeth."

"All the more reason to take them," Morrison countered. "Think of the reputation we'll gain. The crew that took down a military convoy."

Zara kept quiet during the planning sessions, but she noticed things. The convoy's route was too convenient, their security too obvious. It felt like a trap. But Morrison's ego wouldn't let him see it.

The attack began like any other. The *Blood Harvest* dropped out of hyperspace, weapons hot, demanding surrender. The convoy scattered, just as expected. Morrison split his forces to pursue, just as expected.

And then the trap was sprung.

What had appeared to be four transports revealed themselves as military corvettes, bristling with weapons. Hidden fighters launched from concealed bays. In seconds, the hunters became the hunted.

"It's an ambush!" Vance screamed. "All ships, evasive maneuvers!"

But it was too late. Morrison had committed too fully, spread his forces too thin. The *Blood Harvest* shuddered under a barrage of missile impacts. Secondary explosions rocked the ship as systems overloaded.

"Abandon ship!" someone yelled, but Morrison shot them for cowardice.

"We fight!" he roared. "We're Rex Morrison's crew! We don't run!"

But bravado couldn't stop physics. A torpedo found the main reactor, and suddenly the ship was coming apart. Zara was thrown against a bulkhead as gravity failed. Emergency lighting bathed everything in hellish red.

She found herself at an escape pod, along with Marcus and a handful of others. Morrison was still on the bridge, still firing, still refusing to accept defeat.

"We have to go!" Marcus shouted, pulling her toward the pod.

"Wait!" But he was already shoving her inside, slamming the launch button.

The pod ejected just as the *Blood Harvest* exploded. Through the small viewport, Zara watched the ship that had been her prison and her school dissolve into superheated gas. Morrison's final transmission echoed through the pod's speakers—defiant to the end, cursing his enemies even as they burned.

The military ships didn't pursue the escape pods. They'd accomplished their mission, eliminated a major pirate threat. The survivors were left to drift, hoping for rescue that might never come.

It was three days before a salvage crew found them. Three days of dwindling air and water, of deciding who would live and who would die if rescue didn't come. Marcus gave his ration to the younger crew members. He was dead when the salvagers cut open the pod.

The salvage crew didn't ask questions. In the outer systems, survivors were survivors, and their money was as good as anyone's. Zara and the others used what little they had to buy passage to the nearest port, scattering to the four winds.

But Zara didn't run far. Morrison was dead, but his lessons lived on. She'd learned how to survive in the void, how to take what she needed. More importantly, she'd learned what not to do. Morrison's cruelty had made him enemies. His arrogance had made him predictable. His lack of mercy had ensured no one mourned his passing.

She would be different. She would be better.

Standing in a dingy bar on a station whose name she'd already forgotten, Zara raised a glass of rotgut whiskey to the memory of Marcus, the man who'd saved her life. To Lisa Park and her daughter, who might never know a stranger had traded her life for theirs. To all the victims of Rex Morrison, herself included.

"Never again," she whispered, and drank.

She was twenty-one years old, alone in the universe, with blood on her hands and hard-won skills in her head. She could try to return to civilian life, get a legitimate job, pretend the last two years hadn't happened.

Or she could take Morrison's lessons and forge them into something new. Piracy without cruelty. Theft without murder. A code that even criminals could follow.

The choice, as Marcus had said, wasn't a good one. But it was hers to make.

Zara "Bloodhawk" Vega finished her drink and went to find a ship. Her real education was about to begin.
